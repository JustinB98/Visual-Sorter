# Visual-Sorter - A JavaFX Program
A project inspired by youtube sorting videos ***IMPORTED*** ALREADY HAVE BASICS FINISHED

Was originally working on this project locally before github. That's why there isn't much commit history.

Code is sloppy because I worked on this when I was first starting to work with larger projects.

## KNOWN PROBLEMS

* Random crashing 
* On the tutorial mode, the text field will stop updating the text
