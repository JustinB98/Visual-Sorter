# Visual-Sorter - A JavaFX Program
A project inspired by youtube sorting videos ***IMPORTED***

Was originally working on this project locally before github. That's why there isn't much commit history.

Code is sloppy because I worked on this when I was first starting to work with larger projects.

## BUGS

* Rendering issues
* Random crashing (A window will pop up with no text that is meant to warn the user that something went wrong)
* On the tutorial mode, the text field will stop updating the text
