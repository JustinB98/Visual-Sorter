Added a way to set data up from a menu
It's not the greatest looking menu but it's the way it is for now.
Doing this causes the sorter-pref.txt to become useless. But in that I will need to create a new menu soon 
that allows the length of the array to be changed.

Didn't really add anything but did find out that not only is it difficult to write to jar files, it's not recommended.
This means that I can't really achieve the dream to have this project just be an exe file.

But it IS possible to read from jar files... so there's that... The method that does that is: utility.FileUtility.setDataFromFile();
Also the res folder is pretty useless as of now

Added iteration counter and cleaned up some of the code. 
Removed Accepter.java and replaced it with java.util.Runnable.
